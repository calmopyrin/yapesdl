COMPILE
=======
  
  To be able to compile on Linux, you must have the latest SDL
  package from http://libsdl.org. The recent stable release as of time of
  this writing is 2.0.3. You will need the development libraries.
  
  The provided makefile is written for the GNU C++ compiler but can also
  be easily adjusted for other compilers.
  
  It is very likely that if SDL is supported on your system, than Yape can
  be compiled and run. Hence, an Android port is also possible, and Yape has
  been succesfully compiled on Windows and 64 bit Linux systems as well.
  
  Once the libraries and header files are installed, you should
  extract the source tarball to a directory, and simply type:
  
  make
  
  If the compilation finished with no error, you can type:
  
  ./yapesdl [PRG/TAP filename]
  
  to start the emulator, where filename is optional.
  
USAGE
=====

  The user interface isn't yet ready, so you MUST memorise a couple
  of keyboard shortcuts:
  
  F12 or ESCAPE : exits the emulator
  F11		: soft reset
  LCTRL + F11	: forced reset (memory remains intact)
  SHIFT + F11	: hard reset (clear memory, reloads ROMs, rewinds tape)
  
  F5		: press PLAY on tape
  F6		: press STOP on tape
  F7		: save screenshot to BMP file
  F8		: enter the user interface, press F8 again or ESC to quit.
		  You can move around in the menus with the arrow keys, press ENTER for selection.
  
  F9		: quick debugger
  F10		: save current settings to user's home directory

  LALT + 1-3: set window size
  LALT + I	: switch emulated jostick port
  LALT + J	: toggle joystick emulation (via crsr keys)
  LALT + S	: display frame rate on/off  
  LALT + P	: toggle CRT emulation
  LALT + W	: toggle between unlimited speed and 50 Hz frame rate (original speed)
  LALT + ENTER : toggle full screen mode
  
  Internal disk LOAD/SAVE operations are supported to the current
  file system directory, which is usually '/home/<username>/yape'.
  Any PRG files you may wish to load, should go there, although you can browse the directory tree
  from the user interface, too.
   
  This means that an exact filename match will load
  the requested program, similarly can you save a file.
  
  Full ROM banking is supported, currently only via the yape.ini configuration
  file. You must fill in the path for the relevant ROM image you intend to use.
  However, Yape supports some internal ROMs already. These are:
  
  - 'BASIC' 	 - the ROM image containing the BASIC interpreter
  - 'KERNAL' 	 - the system kernal ROM image
  - '3PLUS1LOW'  - the low bank ROM image of the built-in plus/4 software
  - '3PLUS1HIGH' - the high bank ROM image of the built-in plus/4 software
  
KEYBOARD MAPPINGS
=================

  For the keys at different positions, the emulator relies on SDL, so your
  mileage may vary.
  
  There are several keys that need to be mapped to the emulator keyboard
  differently. These are:
