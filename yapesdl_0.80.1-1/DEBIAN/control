  - almost full MOS 7360/8360 aka 'TED' chip emulation
  - almost complete MOS 6569 aka 'VIC-II' chip emulation
  - reasonable MOS 6581/8580 aka 'SID' chip emulation
  - somewhat incomplete CIA 6526 aka 'CIA' emulation
  - real 1541 drive emulation (Read/Write)
  - full ROM banking on +4
  - almost full tape emulation
  - joystick emulation via cursor keys and gamepads
  - PRG, P00, T64, D64 and TAP file format support
  - partial CRT emulation
  - memory expansion emulation (Hannes/REU)
  - serial IEC disk LOAD/SAVE to the file system
  - snapshots / savestates
